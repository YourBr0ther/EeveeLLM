```

**Result:** PASS

---

### 8. Brain Council with Real AI ✅

**Test:** Brain council + NanoGPT integration

**Input:** "Hey Eevee! Want to go explore the forest?"

**Brain Council Deliberation:**
```
1. Prefrontal Cortex ← WINNER
   Decision: agree_cautiously
   Reasoning: Exploring builds experience and strengthens bond
   Score: 0.273

2. Amygdala
   Decision: cautious_maybe
   Reasoning: Nervous but curious... Stay close to trainer?
   Score: 0.243

Consensus: 0.23 (uncertain - showing internal conflict)
Dominant Emotion: cautious
```

**AI Response:**
```
"Eevee's ears perk up slightly but twitch nervously, glancing toward
the forest. 'Vee... veevee!' Eevee takes a small step forward, tail
swishing slowly, but looks up at the trainer for reassurance. With a
soft, hesitant hop, Eevee nudges the trainer's leg, ready to follow
but staying alert."
```

**Analysis:**
✅ Brain council deliberated correctly
✅ AI understood the council's cautious decision
✅ Response showed appropriate hesitation
✅ Body language reflected internal conflict
✅ Authentic Eevee behavior maintained

**Result:** PASS - Excellent integration!
