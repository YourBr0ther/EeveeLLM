# EeveeLLM - Your Living Pokemon Companion

An AI-powered Eevee companion with realistic brain processes, autonomous behavior, and genuine memory formation. Built with a unique "brain council" architecture where different brain regions debate and influence decisions.

## Features

### Currently Implemented (Phases 1-2)

**Phase 1: Foundation** âœ…
- âœ… Interactive terminal interface with color support
- âœ… Eevee state management (hunger, energy, happiness, health)
- âœ… Personality system (curiosity, bravery, playfulness, loyalty, independence)
- âœ… Location-based world with 8 explorable areas
- âœ… NanoGPT API integration with intelligent fallback mode
- âœ… SQLite persistence for state and interactions
- âœ… Natural language responses
- âœ… Relationship tracking (trust and bond)
- âœ… Inventory system
- âœ… Time tracking between sessions

**Phase 2: Brain Council** âœ…
- âœ… **5 Brain Regions**: Prefrontal Cortex (logic), Amygdala (emotion), Hippocampus (memory), Hypothalamus (needs), Cerebellum (instinct)
- âœ… **Weighted Voting System**: Each region votes with reasoning and confidence
- âœ… **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**: Weights change based on context (e.g., Amygdala dominates under threat)
- âœ… **Consensus Calculation**: Measures how unified or conflicted Eevee feels
- âœ… **Debug Visualization**: See internal deliberation with `debug brain` command
- âœ… **Context-Aware Decisions**: Responses reflect brain council's reasoning and emotional state

### Coming Soon (Phases 3-5)
- ðŸ”œ Vector-based memory system with ChromaDB (Phase 3)
- ðŸ”œ Memory consolidation, retrieval, and types (Phase 3)
- ðŸ”œ Autonomous time passage simulation (Phase 4)
- ðŸ”œ Activity generation during time gaps (Phase 4)
- ðŸ”œ Random world events and surprises (Phase 5)
- ðŸ”œ Evolution system (Phase 5)

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/christophervance/EeveeLLM
pip install colorama pyyaml python-dateutil requests
python main.py
```

### Or use the install script:

```bash
./install.sh
python main.py
```

### Configure NanoGPT API (Optional)

The app works in **fallback mode** without an API key! But if you have a NanoGPT API key:

```bash
export NANOGPT_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Or edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
nanogpt_api_key: "your_key_here"
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

- `talk [message]` - Speak to Eevee
- `pet` - Pet Eevee (increases happiness and trust)
- `play` - Play with Eevee (increases bond, costs energy)
- `give [item]` - Give Eevee an item (e.g., "give Oran Berry")
- `observe` - See what Eevee is currently doing
- `stats` - View detailed stats
- `world` - See current location and surroundings
- `go [location]` - Travel to a connected location
- `help` - Show all commands
- `debug brain` - Toggle brain council visualization
- `debug on/off` - Toggle full debug mode
- `exit` - Save and quit

### Example Interaction

```
> talk Hey Eevee!
You: Hey Eevee!

Eevee: *Eevee perks up excitedly* Vee! Veevee! *bounces on paws happily*

> play
You: *initiates playtime*

Eevee: *Eevee runs in excited circles, pouncing on their own tail* Vee vee!

> go meadow
Traveling to Wide Meadow...

> observe
Eevee seems cheerful and full of energy.

Eevee: *Eevee sniffs around excitedly* Vee! *discovering new scents*
```

## World Locations

- **Trainer's Home** - Safe starting point with food and shelter
- **Sunny Garden** - Pleasant garden perfect for playing
- **Wide Meadow** - Open area great for running and exploration
- **Clear Stream** - Fresh water and berry bushes
- **Forest Edge** - Mysterious border of the forest
- **Hidden Den** - Eevee's secret safe space
- **Sunny Hill** - Favorite napping spot with sunset views
- **Deep Forest** - Dangerous but exciting deep woods

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- NanoGPT API settings
- Time acceleration
- Initial personality traits
- Debug options
- UI preferences

## Design Philosophy

**Authenticity Over Complexity** - Eevee should feel *real*, not robotic. Imperfect responses are more believable.

**Memory Makes Meaning** - Every significant interaction matters. Patterns emerge from repeated experiences.

**Time Creates Life** - Autonomous behavior makes Eevee feel alive. Things happen when you're away.
