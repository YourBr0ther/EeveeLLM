# EeveeLLM - Your Living Pokemon Companion

An AI-powered Eevee companion with realistic brain processes, autonomous behavior, and genuine memory formation. Built with a unique "brain council" architecture where different brain regions debate and influence decisions.

## Features

### Currently Implemented (Phases 1-3)

**Phase 1: Foundation** âœ…
- âœ… Interactive terminal interface with color support
- âœ… Eevee state management (hunger, energy, happiness, health)
- âœ… Personality system (curiosity, bravery, playfulness, loyalty, independence)
- âœ… Location-based world with 8 explorable areas
- âœ… NanoGPT API integration with intelligent fallback mode
- âœ… SQLite persistence for state and interactions
- âœ… Natural language responses
- âœ… Relationship tracking (trust and bond)
- âœ… Inventory system
- âœ… Time tracking between sessions

**Phase 2: Brain Council** âœ…
- âœ… **5 Brain Regions**: Prefrontal Cortex (logic), Amygdala (emotion), Hippocampus (memory), Hypothalamus (needs), Cerebellum (instinct)
- âœ… **Weighted Voting System**: Each region votes with reasoning and confidence
- âœ… **Dynamic Weight Adjustments**: Weights change based on context (e.g., Amygdala dominates under threat)
- âœ… **Consensus Calculation**: Measures how unified or conflicted Eevee feels
- âœ… **Debug Visualization**: See internal deliberation with `debug brain` command
- âœ… **Context-Aware Decisions**: Responses reflect brain council's reasoning and emotional state

**Phase 3: Memory System** âœ… NEW!
- âœ… **Vector Memory Storage**: ChromaDB with semantic similarity search
- âœ… **4 Memory Types**: Episodic (events), Semantic (facts), Emotional (associations), Procedural (learned behaviors)
- âœ… **Significance-Based Formation**: Only meaningful interactions (>6.0/10) become long-term memories
- âœ… **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Hippocampus retrieves relevant memories during deliberation
- âœ… **Working Memory**: Short-term context (last 10 interactions)
- âœ… **Memory Browser**: Search and explore Eevee's memories with `remember` command
- âœ… **Automatic Strengthening**: Frequently accessed memories become stronger
- âœ… **Integrated with Brain Council**: Memories directly influence Hippocampus decisions

### Coming Soon (Phases 4-5)
- ðŸ”œ Autonomous time passage simulation (Phase 4)
- ðŸ”œ Activity generation during time gaps (Phase 4)
- ðŸ”œ Random world events and surprises (Phase 5)
- ðŸ”œ Evolution system (Phase 5)

## Installation

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourBr0ther/EeveeLLM.git
   cd EeveeLLM
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install colorama pyyaml python-dateutil requests chromadb sentence-transformers
   ```

3. **Configure API key:**
   ```bash
   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml and add your NanoGPT API key
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Configure NanoGPT API

The app works in **fallback mode** without an API key! But for full AI responses:

1. Get your API key from: https://nano-gpt.com/api
2. Copy the example config:
   ```bash
   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
   ```
3. Edit `config.yaml` and replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key
4. Run the app!

**Note:** `config.yaml` is in `.gitignore` to protect your API key.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

- `talk [message]` - Speak to Eevee
- `pet` - Pet Eevee (increases happiness and trust)
- `play` - Play with Eevee (increases bond, costs energy)
- `give [item]` - Give Eevee an item (e.g., "give Oran Berry")
- `observe` - See what Eevee is currently doing
- `stats` - View detailed stats
- `world` - See current location and surroundings
- `go [location]` - Travel to a connected location
- `remember [query]` - Browse Eevee's memories (NEW in Phase 3!)
- `help` - Show all commands
- `debug brain` - Toggle brain council visualization
- `debug memory` - Toggle memory formation visualization (NEW!)
- `debug on/off` - Toggle full debug mode
- `exit` - Save and quit

### Example Interaction

```
> talk Hey Eevee!
You: Hey Eevee!

Eevee: *Eevee perks up excitedly* Vee! Veevee! *bounces on paws happily*

> play
You: *initiates playtime*

Eevee: *Eevee runs in excited circles, pouncing on their own tail* Vee vee!

> go meadow
Traveling to Wide Meadow...

> observe
Eevee seems cheerful and full of energy.

Eevee: *Eevee sniffs around excitedly* Vee! *discovering new scents*
```

## World Locations

- **Hidden Den** - Eevee's secret safe space
- **Sunny Hill** - Favorite napping spot with sunset views
- **Deep Forest** - Dangerous but exciting deep woods

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- NanoGPT API settings
- Time acceleration
- Initial personality traits
- Debug options
- UI preferences

## Design Philosophy

**Authenticity Over Complexity** - Eevee should feel *real*, not robotic. Imperfect responses are more believable.

**Memory Makes Meaning** - Every significant interaction matters. Patterns emerge from repeated experiences.

**Time Creates Life** - Autonomous behavior makes Eevee feel alive. Things happen when you're away.
