### To Run the Application (with Phase 3 Memory)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourBr0ther/EeveeLLM.git
cd EeveeLLM
pip install colorama pyyaml python-dateutil requests chromadb sentence-transformers
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml  # Add your API key if you have one
python main.py
```

### To See Phase 3 Memory System in Action
```
# Enable memory visualization
> debug memory

# Talk to Eevee (memories will form for significant interactions)
> talk Let's go explore the scary forest together!

# Browse memories
> remember
> remember forest
> remember trainer
```

### To See Brain Council + Memory Integration
```
> debug brain
> talk Want to explore the forest?
# Watch the Hippocampus retrieve relevant memories!
```
