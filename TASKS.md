# EeveeLLM Development Tasks

## Project Overview
Building an Eevee AI companion with brain council decision-making, autonomous behavior simulation, memory systems, and a text-based terminal interface.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create basic terminal UI with text input/output
- [x] Implement Eevee state management (stats, location)
- [x] Build simple location system (8 locations)
- [x] Integrate NanoGPT API client
- [x] Implement basic response generation (no brain council yet)
- [x] Create configuration system
- [x] Set up SQLite database for state persistence

## Phase 2: Brain Council (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement 5 brain region classes (Prefrontal, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Hypothalamus, Cerebellum)
- [x] Create decision voting system with weighted votes
- [x] Build brain council orchestration
- [x] Add brain council debate logging
- [x] Implement debug mode to see internal deliberation
- [x] Add context-aware response modulation
- [x] Dynamic weight adjustments based on context (e.g., Amygdala dominates under threat)
- [x] Consensus calculation and conflict visualization
- [x] Emotional state determination from brain regions

## Phase 3: Memory System (Week 3)
- [ ] Integrate ChromaDB for vector storage
- [ ] Implement memory formation and storage
- [ ] Build memory retrieval for context
- [ ] Support multiple memory types (episodic, semantic, emotional, procedural)
- [ ] Create memory browser command
- [ ] Add memory consolidation logic

## Phase 4: Time Passage (Week 4)
- [ ] Implement time tracking between sessions
- [ ] Create activity generation engine
- [ ] Build autonomous behavior simulation
- [ ] Add memory creation during time gaps
- [ ] Generate timeline summaries
- [ ] Handle hourly and daily events

## Phase 5: Polish & Expansion (Week 5+)
- [ ] Add personality trait influence on decisions
- [ ] Implement complex emotional responses
- [ ] Build item/inventory system
- [ ] Create richer world interactions
- [ ] Add special events and surprises
- [ ] Consider evolution mechanics
